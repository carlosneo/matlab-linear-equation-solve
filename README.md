matlab-linear-equation-solve
============================

Repository that contains some implementation in matlab to solve linear systems equations.

Gauss Jacobi and Gauss Siedel, solve the linear sistem from those method.
The Gauss Jordan has three versions, the jordan.m, has the matrix initialized inside the .m file. the jordan_identidade.m it`s the some, but has a check if the matrix that it`s initialized it`s a identity, if it is the problem it`s already solved and the cpu it`s saved. The jordan_2.m you have to input the matrix by matlab console.
